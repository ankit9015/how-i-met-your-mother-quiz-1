# how-i-met-your-mother-quiz-1
This is a CLI App, it asks trivia about the show "How I Met Your Mother". 

The user answers the trivia and at the and a score is given for the number of right answer. The app is built using NodeJS, Readline-sync and Chalk.

I am making this app in a slew of other projects under the neog.camp level zero curriculum.
